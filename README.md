I‚Äôm an experienced marketer making a career pivot. I have worked in fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) for my entire career. I have done lots, from new product development to brand strategy. I have worked for a number of different organisations from the multinational to my own start ups. But I‚Äôm looking for a change. I have zeroed in on data analysis/science as the area. 

What kept me in FMCG brand management for so long was the diversity. You work across the marketing mix so on any given day you might be writing a brief for an advertising agency; talking with a factory about a new product; pitching to a major retailer; or trawling the numbers for useful information. 

Over the years I have come to realise that my strengths have naturally been in pulling together insights for use in business. I love turning raw data into something useful. I love crafting the narrative. I love delivering the story, be it to a colleague, a pitch room or a larger audience. 

I decided to lean into this passion and develop more sophisticated technical skills to move me out of Excel and into Python and SQL. You can see some of what I‚Äôve done through that process in my repos. I‚Äôm now looking to get some experience so I can effectively transition into a full time data role. This is where you come in!

### Projects
I‚Äôm on the hunt for some real world projects to work on. If you have a pile of data sitting around that you suspect holds some gold which you haven‚Äôt been able to extract yet, let‚Äôs have a chat. 

### Jobs
Given my experience in marketing and business and my communication skills, I know there are places for someone like me. Roles where a nice blend of quant and comms are just what the doctor ordered. I have a good grasp of how to get to the bottom of what people want information wise and experience in wrangling into useful shapes and sizes. Fruitfully collaborating with colleagues of all stripes has been a central theme to my work life. If there is a Dom-shaped hole in your organisation, let's chat!
